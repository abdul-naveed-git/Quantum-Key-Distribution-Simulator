# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Simulator
The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Simulator is a software-based project designed to simulate secure key exchange using fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. This project demonstrates how two parties can securely generate and share cryptographic keys while detecting the presence of any eavesdropper.

The simulator models the complete QKD workflow, including quantum state preparation, transmission, measurement, basis reconciliation, key sifting, and error detection. It simulates well-known QKD protocols such as BB84, showcasing how quantum properties like superposition and the no-cloning theorem ensure communication security.

The system also introduces an eavesdropper simulation, where interception attempts result in detectable errors in the key, emphasizing the inherent security advantages of quantum communication over classical methods.

This project serves as an educational and experimental tool to understand the working of quantum cryptography without requiring real quantum hardware. It highlights the future potential of quantum-secure communication systems in protecting sensitive data.
